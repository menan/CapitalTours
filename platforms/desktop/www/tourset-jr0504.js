How will you celebrate?</p>\n<h3>Written in stone or ever-changing?</h3>\n<p>Around the outside of the Flame are the official Shields and flowers of each province and territory at the time of the Centennial, arranged in the order in which they joined Canada. <br>\n It took 82 years after Confederation began for all the provinces and territories existing in 1867 to join, each for their own reasons. <br>\n You may notice that Nunavut's Shield is missing. Canada's newest territory was only created in 1999, 132 years after Confederation began and 32 years after these carvings were made. <br>\n Our country is ever-changing as we find new ways to include and represent Canada's many peoples.</p>\n<h3>An enduring symbol</h3>\n<p>The Centennial Flame is not eternal. In fact, it was only supposed to last for the Centennial year. But this symbol was so greatly loved, it has become a permanent monument on the Hill. </p>\n<h3>Other Centennial monuments</h3>\n<p>A time of celebration, the Centennial was marked by other monuments and projects, such as the monument to William Lyon Mackenzie King here on the Hill, and the Garden of the Provinces on Confederation Boulevard. </p>",

At the laying of the Centre Block corner stone in 1860, the site was a muddy construction zone, and loggers mingled with royalty at the celebrations. <br>\n Parliament first sat in Centre Block in 1866; the famed Victoria Tower was completed in 1878. </p>\n<h3>A great fire</h3>\n<p>On a dark February night in 1916, Centre Block caught fire. As the flames spread, senators, staff and soldiers alike worked frantically to save what they could of the priceless art and parliamentary documents. One fire marshal spent the entire night on the roof of the Library of Parliament stamping out embers while his fellow firemen tried desperately to put out the fire.<br>\n In the cold light of morning, it became evident that the building could not be salvaged; even the Victoria Tower's bell had fallen. Only the Library still stood. <br>\n There was some evidence that the fire was caused by faulty electrical wiring. But because this was 1916 and the height of WWI, conspiracy theories abounded. </p>\n<h3>Government rolls on</h3>\n<p>The fire may have left Parliament without their chambers and offices, but Senators and Members of Parliament did not stop the work of governing. <a href='#definition' def='#def-cabinet' rel='definition'  data-rel='dialog' data-transition='slidedown' >Cabinet</a> convened in the Chateau Laurier across the canal. Parliament was held in the Victoria Museum, now the Museum of Nature; it was there that the law giving women the vote was passed in 1918.</p>\n<h3>Centre Block, old and new</h3>\n<p>The new Centre Block held true to the spirit of the old. Although its lines were cleaner and simpler, and there was an increased emphasis on function, many ornate details such as carved animals were included. Have a look at the photo gallery to compare the old with the new. <br>\n The new Centre Block's corner stone was laid by Prime Minister Robert Borden in 1916, and the building was opened to Parliament in 1920.</p><div id='def-cabinet' class='definition'><p>A committee composed of the Prime Minister and Members of Parliament whom he appoints as Cabinet Ministers; each of these usually holds a portfolio such as health or finance.

Essentially, they had to make a choice: to be aboriginal or to be Canadian. They could not be both. <br>\n Deifenbaker overturned this unjust law that bothered him deeply. But he met with resistance from Aboriginal leaders, who feared the loss of their Status rights and treatied lands. It was thanks to ongoing dialogue and the work of Senator Gladstone that this fear was dispelled. <br>\n This episode in history has carried an important lesson for Canada.

This signified a commitment to the unity of these two regions, originally colonies of England and France – former enemies.</p>\n<h3>Far from the southern border</h3>\n<p>Finally, it was a safe distance from the American border. Should the Americans ever try to invade, Ottawa would have time prepare its defense – important at a time in which both of these countries were still striving to define their borders and identities. </p>\n<h3>A natural choice for national capital</h3>\n<p>When Queen Victoria gave her royal assent to the creation of the Dominion of Canada in 1867, Ottawa was, once again, suggested as the capital. <br>\n Because of the advantages that would go with this honour, many cities vied for the position, and the Queen's suggestion was hotly debated.

While she never visited Canada, the culture of Victorian England was very influential in the young country and its capital, especially among the upper class. <br>\n Conservative morals, somber fashion, Gothic architecture, an interest in industry and the idea that Canada was, despite its independence, part of the British Empire – these were all aspects of early Canadian culture that linked back to England, and Queen Victoria.</p>\n<h3>A vision of Canada's relationship with her Queen</h3>\n<p>In this memorial to Queen Victoria, sculptor Louis Phillipe Hébert strove to capture the relationship between Canada and its Queen. <br>\n The Queen herself, high atop the statue, seems stern and distant. She holds a scroll that says &quot;Constitutional Liberty&quot;, a sign of Canada's independence.<br>\n Canada is represented by a young woman wearing a mix of peasant robes and armour (see the gorget at her neck). She appears a little off-balance, as she strives to offer her Queen a laurel wreath, a symbol of praise and victory. <br>\nHébert explained that the royal lion beside Canada was a &quot;vigilant guardian of flag, territorial dominion, and national honour,&quot; signifying the Crown's ongoing importance.</p>",

He surely could never of imagined how it would turn out.<br>\n When he lost his young wife to an early death, Mackenzie threw himself into his work as a stonemason. He also got involved in politics, campaigning for fellow reformist George Brown. <br>\n Having built a reputation for honesty and hard work, Mackenzie was elected to our very first Parliament in 1867. <br>\n When Sir John A. Macdonald resigned due to the CPR scandal, Mackenzie, then leader of the Liberal party, was called upon to form a government. In 1873, Alexander Mackenzie – stonemason, immigrant in pursuit of love – became Canada's second Prime Minister. </p>\n<h3>A working man through and through</h3>\n<p>In Mackenzie's day, it was unusual for a man with such a humble background to achieve a powerful position in Canadian politics. But Mackenzie never forgot his working class origins. <br>\n After his term as Prime Minister, Mackenzie made a trip to England that left him greatly disillusioned with high society. He found the people there to be stuffy and uninterested in the distant colony of Canada. <br>\n When offered a title, which would have made him Sir Alexander, he stoutly refused – three times.<br>\n Although the next seven Prime Ministers would accept a title, Mackenzie lead the way in dissociating Canadian leadership from British titles.</p>",

At the laying of the Centre Block corner stone in 1860, the site was a muddy construction zone, and loggers mingled with royalty at the celebrations. <br>\n Parliament first sat in Centre Block in 1866; the famed Victoria Tower was completed in 1878. </p>\n<h3>A great fire</h3>\n<p>On a dark February night in 1916, Centre Block caught fire. As the flames spread, senators, staff and soldiers alike worked frantically to save what they could of the priceless art and parliamentary documents. One fire marshal spent the entire night on the roof of the Library of Parliament stamping out embers while his fellow firemen tried desperately to put out the fire.<br>\n In the cold light of morning, it became evident that the building could not be salvaged; even the Victoria Tower's bell had fallen. Only the Library still stood. <br>\n There was some evidence that the fire was caused by faulty electrical wiring. But because this was 1916 and the height of WWI, conspiracy theories abounded. </p>\n<h3>Government rolls on</h3>\n<p>The fire may have left Parliament without their chambers and offices, but Senators and Members of Parliament did not stop the work of governing. Cabinet convened in the Chateau Laurier across the canal. Parliament was held in the Victoria Museum, now the Museum of Nature; it was there that the law giving women the vote was passed in 1918.</p>\n<h3>Centre Block, old and new</h3>\n<p>The new Centre Block held true to the spirit of the old. Although its lines were cleaner and simpler, and there was an increased emphasis on function, many ornate details such as carved animals were included. Have a look at the photo gallery to compare the old with the new. <br>\n The new Centre Block's corner stone was laid by Prime Minister Robert Borden in 1916, and the building was opened to Parliament in 1920.</p>",

He appointed the first Aboriginal Senator, James Gladstone; the first woman to Cabinet, Ellen Fairclough; and nominated the first French Canadian for Governor General, Georges Vanier. </p>\n<h3>The Aboriginal right to vote </h3>\n<p>Before 1960, Aboriginal Canadians had to give up their Indian Status and any rights associated with it, such as the right to live in their communities, in order to vote. Essentially, they had to make a choice: to be aboriginal or to be Canadian. They could not be both. <br>\n Deifenbaker overturned this unjust law that bothered him deeply. But he met with resistance from Aboriginal leaders, who feared the loss of their Status rights and treatied lands. It was thanks to ongoing dialogue and the work of Senator Gladstone that this fear was dispelled. <br>\n This episode in history has carried an important lesson for Canada.

The sculptor has depicted a young Canada's relationship with its Queen in this statue.</p>\n<h3>A long reign, a long reach</h3>\n<p>During Queen Victoria's 64-year reign (1837-1901), Canada went from British colony to autonomous country. While she never visited Canada, the culture of Victorian England was very influential in the young country and its capital, especially among the upper class. <br>\n Conservative morals, somber fashion, Gothic architecture, an interest in industry and the idea that Canada was, despite its independence, part of the British Empire – these were all aspects of early Canadian culture that linked back to England, and Queen Victoria.</p>\n<h3>A vision of Canada's relationship with her Queen</h3>\n<p>In this memorial to Queen Victoria, sculptor Louis Phillipe Hébert strove to capture the relationship between Canada and its Queen. <br>\n The Queen herself, high atop the statue, seems stern and distant. She holds a scroll that says &quot;Constitutional Liberty&quot;, a sign of Canada's independence.<br>\n Canada is represented by a young woman wearing a mix of peasant robes and armour (see the gorget at her neck). She appears a little off-balance, as she strives to offer her Queen a laurel wreath, a symbol of praise and victory. <br>\nHébert explained that the royal lion beside Canada was a &quot;vigilant guardian of flag, territorial dominion, and national honour,&quot; signifying the Crown's ongoing importance.</p>",

He surely could never of imagined how it would turn out.<br>\n When he lost his young wife to an early death, Mackenzie threw himself into his work as a stonemason. He also got involved in politics, campaigning for fellow reformist George Brown. <br>\n Having built a reputation for honesty and hard work, Mackenzie was elected to our very first Parliament in 1867. <br>\n When Sir John A. Macdonald resigned due to the CPR scandal, Mackenzie, then leader of the Liberal party, was called upon to form a government. In 1873, Alexander Mackenzie – stonemason, immigrant in pursuit of love – became Canada's second Prime Minister. </p>\n<h3>A working man through and through</h3>\n<p>In Mackenzie's day, it was unusual for a man with such a humble background to achieve a powerful position in Canadian politics. But Mackenzie never forgot his working class origins. <br>\n After his term as Prime Minister, Mackenzie made a trip to England that left him greatly disillusioned with high society. He found the people there to be stuffy and uninterested in the distant colony of Canada. <br>\n When offered a title, which would have made him Sir Alexander, he stoutly refused – three times.<br>\n Although the next seven Prime Ministers would accept a title, Mackenzie lead the way in dissociating Canadian leadership from British titles.</p>",
