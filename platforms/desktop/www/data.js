The East Block and West Block were commissioned in 1859, and the Centre Block was commissioned in 1916 after the original burned down.</p>\n<h3>Examples of Gothic Revival architecture</h3>\n<p>All three buildings are Gothic Revival in style. With roots in medieval architecture, this style is characterized by pointed arches, high windows, irregularly shaped stones and asymmetrical design. The principle of picturesque eclecticism &mdash; a cobbling together of historical flourishes &mdash; is best seen in the East Block and West Block.</p>\n<h3>A symbolic choice linking us to Britain</h3>\n<p>The choice of the Gothic Revival style creates a strong association with the British Parliament Buildings at Westminster. This tie was important in 1859, when Canada was still a province of Britain and not yet its own country. And yet, our Parliament Buildings do differ from the British ones. They are not so strictly Gothic.</p>\n<h3>A symbolic choice distancing us from republicanism</h3>\n<p>Gothic Revival&rsquo;s association with medieval churches also suggests longevity and conservativism. This contrasts with the republican, even revolutionary, undertones of the neoclassical style of Capitol Hill in the United States.</p>\n<h3>A practical choice for the times, and the future</h3>\n<p>The Gothic Revival style was immensely popular when the Parliament Buildings were built. In some ways, it was our first national style of architecture. Many of the materials were readily available in the area, and local masons and craftsmen were skilled in the style.

Compare the West Block with the Centre Block&rsquo;s cleaner, less picturesque lines.</p>\n<h3>Inspiring a sense of the past, but designed for change</h3>\n<p>The West Block&rsquo;s use of picturesque eclecticism has allowed for change over time. It opened in 1865, and the Mackenzie Tower was added between 1874 and 1878. The building was gutted by fire in 1897, and received a major overhaul. In 1960&ndash;1961, the Confederation Room was added for official receptions, and the rest of the building&rsquo;s interior was modernized.

When the&nbsp;<a def='#def-Dominion-of-Canada' rel='definition' href='#definition'>Dominion of Canada</a>&nbsp;was created in 1867, he became our first parliamentary librarian.</p>\n<h3>A round building to symbolize dialogue and learning</h3>\n<p>Todd proposed the Library&rsquo;s distinctive circular shape. He was inspired by medieval chapterhouses, the part of the monastery where meetings are held and the Bible is discussed. The Library&rsquo;s pointed arches, stained glass windows and flying buttresses are also reminiscent of chapterhouses. The many-coloured stones and iron cresting create visual connections with the other Parliament Buildings&rsquo; Gothic Revival style.</p>\n<h3>An ever-growing collection</h3>\n<p>When the Library&rsquo;s construction began, Todd had just returned from Europe, where he had acquired 17,000 books for the Legislative Assembly. By 1866, he had increased the collection to 47,000 volumes, which he had moved into the new Library by river barge. Today, the Library&rsquo;s collection contains 17 linear kilometres of materials!</p>\n<h3>Designing for disaster</h3>\n<p>Todd insisted on heavy iron doors and a building slightly separated from the rest of the Centre Block to protect against fire.

The number on his certificate is&hellip; 1!</p>\n<h3>Asserting Canada&rsquo;s independence</h3>\n<p>King worked tirelessly for Canadian autonomy throughout his career. He made a point of allowing Parliament, not Britain, to determine whether or not Canada would fight in the Second World War. He greatly increased Canada&rsquo;s military and political autonomy over the course of the war. In 1923, Canada signed its first international treaty not co-signed by Great Britan: the Halibut Treaty.</p>\n<h3>Winning the battle, winning the war</h3>\n<p>Although initially slow to fanthom the Nazi threat, King used the Second World War to leverage Canada into position as a key Western ally and a major economic power. Politically, he managed the domestic front by delaying national conscription. Many Canadians credited him with leading the country&rsquo;s contribution to Allied victory in 1945.</p>\n<h3>Transforming the Capital</h3>\n<p>King left important legacies in the Capital, both tangible and intangible. He transformed the civil service, inaugurated the Peace Tower in 1927, and had many Parliament Hill monuments commissioned. He oversaw the construction of Confederation Square and the National War Memorial. As final gifts, he bequeathed to the nation Laurier House (left to him by his friend and mentor Sir Wilfrid Laurier) and his Kingsmere estate located in Gatineau Park.

But when rebellion broke out in Ireland, he advocated a more Canadian approach, modelled on Confederation: self-governance within the British Empire.

On April 7, 1868, McGee was shot down on the doorstep of his Sparks Street boarding house after leaving a late-night parliamentary session. The event caused a national uproar and, to this day, remains the only assassination of a federal politician in Canadian history. Patrick James Whelan, an Irish immigrant, was hanged for the crime.

Todd established the dual roles of library employees: to assist parliamentarians in consulting the Library&rsquo;s 17 linear kilometres of materials, and to research and report on specific issues at the request of parliamentarians. Today, the Library also provides visitor and outreach services to the public on behalf of parliamentarians.</p>\n<h3>A prodigious beginning</h3>\n<p>Todd emigrated to Canada from London, England, with his parents, when he was 12. At 13, he made an engraved map of Toronto, which caught the eye of a local lawyer. By 15, Todd was assistant librarian to the Legislative Assembly. Self-educated, he published his first book on the practice of parliamentary government at the age of 20. The book was adopted as the official guide for the&nbsp;<a def='#def-Province-of-Canada' rel='definition' href='#definition'>Province of Canada</a>&rsquo;s inaugural Legislative Assembly, to which he soon became chief librarian.</p>\n<h3>The Capital&rsquo;s first librarian</h3>\n<p>When Ottawa was chosen as the Capital in 1857, Todd was consulted about the Library&rsquo;s design. He suggested the round shape and the heavy iron doors that later saved the Library from fire. He also collected many of the Library&rsquo;s first materials. When Ottawa became the capital of the new&nbsp;<a def='#def-Dominion-of-Canada' rel='definition' href='#definition'>Dominion of Canada</a>, Todd became our very first parliamentary librarian.</p>\n<h3>Shaping the practice of Parliament</h3>\n<p>Todd wrote many research papers on constitutional practice that, together, made a major contribution to the parliamentary process.

He wrote of the need &ldquo;to resist the encroachments of the tide of democratic ascendancy, which is everywhere uprising, and threatening to overwhelm &lsquo;the powers that be.&rsquo;&rdquo; Todd&rsquo;s thinking may seem outdated, but many of the practices he instituted in Parliament and in the Library are still in use today.

This flexibility allowed him to remain relevant over a long period of time. For example, after the Second World War, he began an ambitious program of social reform at odds with his wartime position.

Il appuie &eacute;galement le projet du Canadien Pacifique. Le chemin de fer unifie le jeune pays tant du point de vue &eacute;conomique que symbolique, tout en prot&eacute;geant le territoire encore incertain de l&rsquo;expansion am&eacute;ricaine.</p>\n<h3>Atteint par le scandale&hellip;</h3>\n<p>Macdonald est un chef g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement fort et respect&eacute;, mais sa carri&egrave;re est ent&acirc;ch&eacute;e par un scandale. Accus&eacute; d&rsquo;avoir accepter des pots-de-vin dans le cadre du projet du Canadien Pacifique, il d&eacute;missionne en 1873.</p>\n<h3>&hellip;mais r&eacute;&eacute;lu</h3>\n<p>M&ecirc;me si sa r&eacute;putation est ternie, Macdonald est r&eacute;&eacute;lu en 1878. Les Canadiens lui font confiance pour ce qui est d&rsquo;&eacute;laborer les politiques nationales qui aideront le pays &agrave; sortir de la crise &eacute;conomique. Ils le savent aussi capable d&rsquo;assurer l&rsquo;ach&egrave;vement de la construction du chemin de fer. Son humour spirituel et chaleureux ainsi que ses r&eacute;alisations incitent le peuple &agrave; lui pardonner facilement. Il est r&eacute;&eacute;lu en 1882, puis en 1887 et en 1891.</p>\n<h3>Un h&eacute;ritage national durable</h3>\n<p>Macdonald supervise la construction de la plupart des &eacute;difices du Parlement. Il instaure le r&eacute;seau national de parcs et de lieux historiques plus tard g&eacute;r&eacute;s par Parcs Canada (la colline du Parlement est l&rsquo;un de ces lieux).
